            p.section-heading Telemetry, Tracking &amp; Command Subsystem (TTC)

            p.section-text
                | The Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&amp;C) or communication subsystem
                | of the SRMSAT&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 provides the interface between the spacecraft
                | and ground systems. Payload mission data and spacecraft housekeeping data pass
                | from the spacecraft through this system to the operations center. Operator
                | commands are also passed to the spacecraft through this subsystem to control
                | the spacecraft and to operate the payload. As part of carrier tracking,
                | most spacecraft TT&amp;C subsystems generate a downlink RF signal that is
                | phase coherent to the uplink signal.
                | This two-way coherent mode allows measuring Doppler shift from which range rate
                | or line of sight velocity between the spacecraft and tracking antenna is calculated.
                | This knowledge allows operators to scan fewer frequencies and thus, acquire spacecraft
                | more quickly. This Doppler ranging operation can also be used for navigation.

            p.section-text
                | The functions of the TTC subsystem include Carrier Tracking, Command Reception and Detection,
                | Ranging, and some subsystem operations.

            p.section-heading Electrical Power System (EPS)

            p.section-text
                | The Electrical Power System ensures that a continuous source of electrical power
                | is present to the spacecraft loads throughout the mission duration.
                | The subsystem generates power through the solar panels on the spacecraft and stores
                | it in the battery, and supplies the stored power when necessary. EPS uses regulators
                | to ensure that power is supplied at the rated voltages for components. All power
                | lines are monitored by voltage and current sensors and protection is provided for
                | loads against damage from electrical fault. EPS also provides command and telemetry
                | capability for EPS health and status, as well as control by ground station.

            p.section-heading On-Board Computer (OBC)

            p.section-text
                | On-Board Computer (OBC) is figuratively the brain to SRMSAT-2.
                | It controls all the other subsystems of the satellite. It collects,
                | analyses, and takes necessary actions from the information collected
                | from different parts of the satellite. This is done with the help of
                | a software architecture which provides a complete functional overview
                | of the OBC. It is responsible for data communication between the satellite
                | and the ground station. It collects the telemetry data and then encodes
                | it for transmitting it to the ground station. This is achieved by using
                | recommended standards like CCSDS which increases inter-operability and
                | efficiency. The on-board software is developed around ATSAMA5D35-CM,
                | a microcontroller which plays a vital role in the functioning of the satellite.
                | Error Detection and Correction techniques like Reed Solomon and Hamming Codes
                | are used to handle memory corruption issues caused by the rough
                | and harsh space environment.
