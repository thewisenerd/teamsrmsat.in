                | This subsystem, though not physically associated with the spacecraft,
                | is associated critically with spacecraft design. The subsystem&rsquo;s
                | preliminary work is to choose a transfer profile to achieve final mission
                | orbit and lay out total propulsion requirements. The Mission analysis segment
                | is responsible for checking the astrodynamic feasibility of each solution
                | in a dynamic envelope of possibilities in terms of analyses of error sources,
                | risks involved, injection constraints and sensitivity.

                | Guidance Navigation and Control is responsible orbit determination,
                | prediction, and control. The primary task of the subsystem would be
                | to give preliminary and precise OD to support all phases of trajectory
                | within bounds. The subsystem will be responsible for the pre-flight design
                | of optimal deterministic maneuvers and in-flight design of statistical maneuvers
                | for trajectory/orbit maintenance and control within capture corridors for the
                | transfer trajectory. GNC will comprise of a Ground Flight dynamics segment with
                | personnel and infrastructure to support the mission during its lifetime to suffice
                | successful transfer, Lunar Orbit Injection, and Stationkeeping.

                | The ADCS subsystem is responsible for determining and controlling the
                | spacecraft attitude in space. The main functions of the ADCS subsystem
                | can be divided into Determination, Prediction, and Control. Attitude
                | determination is the process of computing the spacecraft orientation,
                | within a pre-defined accuracy, using the data obtained from the on-board
                | sensors. Attitude prediction is the process of forecasting the future attitude
                | using dynamic models, and attitude control is the process of orienting the
                | satellite in a specified direction using actuators and momentum exchange devices.
